# Data Cleaning Steps
Handling missing values and duplicates
Converting data types where necessary
Cleaning categorical columns (like cuisines and locations)
Removing outliers from numerical columns (like cost and rating)
<br>


# Key Insights
Some of the insights discovered through EDA:

Restaurants offering online delivery tend to have higher average ratings.
